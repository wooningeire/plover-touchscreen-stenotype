# On-screen stenotype
On-screen touchscreen stenotype plugin for Plover.

## Recommended setup
Operationg systems may have built-in touchscreen gestures that sometimes prevent the window from receiving touches.

Windows 10/11 users: This works best after disabling 3- and 4-finger touch gestures in Settings ([`Bluetooth & devices` > `Touch`](ms-settings:devices-touch), or navigate to `ms-settings:devices-touch` from the browser).
